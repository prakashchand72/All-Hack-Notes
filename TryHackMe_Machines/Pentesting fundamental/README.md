**Penetration Testing Methodologies**

***stages of methodologies***

_step 1: Information Gathering_

```
This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information 
about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research. 
```
>Note: This doesn't include the scanning of the system 

_step2: Enumeration/Scanning_

```
This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems.
 For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
```
_step3:Exploitation_

```
This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. 
This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
```
_step4: Privilege Escalation_

```
Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), 
this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, 
where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), 



whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).
```
_step5:Post Exploitation_

```
This stage involves a few sub-stages:
1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)

2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user

3.  Covering your tracks

4. Reporting
```
**Some Of Important Framework**

OSSTMM [**The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual**](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)

OWASP [**Open Web Application Security Project**](https://owasp.org/)

NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1 [**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

NCSC CAF [**Cyber Assessment Framework**](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance)

-----------------------------



**Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing**

_Black-Box Testing_

```
This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information 
about the inner workings of the application or service.
```
_Grey-Box Testing_

```
The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the 
application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the 
application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application 
to try and resolve issues as they find them.
```
_White-Box Testing_

```
This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer 
who knows programming and application logic.
```
